Notes about project:
- The only files used are WFApp/settings.py, WFApp/urls.py, templates/dashboard/index.html, dashboard/views.py, and dashboard/urls.py
- This project does not configure the SQL database through Django, but instead uses Pyodbc to connect to the database. Please see Pyodbc on Github for details regarding that.
- Some of the scripts and css files included in index.html may be unneeded, and may require this project, upon distribution, to attach a notice of recognition of these
libraries to conform to their copyright licenses. I believe the licenses are all very basic and simply require preservation of the licences.
- Any questions or concerns about this project can be emailed to the Author above.
